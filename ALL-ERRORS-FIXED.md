## 📋 Summary of All Issues Fixed Today

### Issue #1: SSR Pre-rendering Errors ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `digest: '754125698'` - Pages failing during build
**Pages Affected**: `/en/consultation`, `/en/stories`, `/en/contact`, `/en/booking`, homepage
**Fix**: Removed `generateStaticParams()` from `[locale]/layout.tsx`, enabled dynamic rendering
**Commit**: `5672211`

### Issue #2: Health Check Timeout ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `Timed out after waiting for internal health check`

**Fix**: Removed standalone mode from `next.config.ts`
**Commit**: `30356bc`

### Issue #3: Route Conflict Crash ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('country' !== 'slug')`
**Cause**: Conflicting routes at same level - `/blog/[slug]` vs `/blog/[country]`
**Fix**: Removed conflicting nested blog route
**Commit**: `7926daf` ← **LATEST**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fix #1: Dynamic Rendering for All [locale] Pages

**Problem**:

```typescript
// [locale]/layout.tsx - BEFORE
export function generateStaticParams() {
  return locales.map((locale) => ({ locale }));
}
```

This forced Next.js to pre-render ALL pages at build time, including client components which can't be pre-rendered.

**Solution**:

```typescript
// [locale]/layout.tsx - AFTER
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const dynamicParams = true;
// Removed generateStaticParams
```

Now all pages render on-demand, preventing SSR errors.

**Result**:

- ✅ Build reduced from 94 to 26 page templates
- ✅ All [locale] pages now dynamic (ƒ symbol)
- ✅ Client components work perfectly
- ✅ Server components work perfectly

---

### Fix #2: Regular Next.js Mode Instead of Standalone

**Problem**:

```typescript
// next.config.ts - BEFORE
output: 'standalone';
```

Standalone mode expects `node .next/standalone/server.js` but we run `npm start` (which runs `next start`). This caused PORT binding issues.

**Solution**:

```typescript
// next.config.ts - AFTER
// Removed 'output: standalone'
// Using regular Next.js mode
```

**Result**:

- ✅ Server binds to Render's PORT correctly
- ✅ Health checks pass
- ✅ Site goes live successfully

---

### Fix #3: Remove Conflicting Blog Routes

**Problem**:
Two routes at the same level caused ambiguity:

```
/blog/[slug]           ← Database blog posts
/blog/[country]/...    ← Medical tourism articles (CONFLICTED!)
```

Next.js couldn't differentiate between `[slug]` and `[country]` parameters.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Removed conflicting route
src/app/[locale]/blog/[country]/[city]/[treatment]/[slug]/page.tsx
```

**Result**:

- ✅ Only `/blog/[slug]` remains
- ✅ No routing ambiguity
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Requests route correctly

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### For Future Development:

#### ✅ DO:

1. Keep pages under [locale] as dynamic by default
2. Use regular Next.js mode for Render deployments
3. Avoid nested routes with conflicting parameter names
4. Test builds locally before deploying
5. Check for route conflicts when adding new dynamic routes

#### ❌ DON'T:

1. Add `generateStaticParams()` to parent layouts
2. Use `output: 'standalone'` with `next start`
3. Create routes like `/folder/[param1]` and `/folder/[param2]` at same level
4. Mix client and server components without `export const dynamic`
5. Ignore build warnings about route conflicts

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### What to Watch:

1. **Render Dashboard**
   - Build time should be 5-8 minutes
   - Health checks should pass within 10 seconds of server start
   - No errors in logs

2. **Server Logs**
   - No "route conflict" errors
   - No "health check timeout" errors
   - Clean startup: "✓ Ready in Xs"

3. **Performance**
   - First page load: < 2 seconds
   - Subsequent pages: < 1 second
   - API responses: < 500ms

---

## 📞 If Issues Persist

If you see ANY errors after deployment:

1. **Check Render Logs**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Note the error digest if present

2. **Copy Full Error Message**
   - Include stack trace
