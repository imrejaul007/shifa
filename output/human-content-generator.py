Here's something that might surprise you: Bangalore has more JCI-accredited hospitals than any other city in Asia. That's not marketing—it's fact. And these aren't just good hospitals; they're where doctors trained at Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic are now practicing.

### The Real Numbers

Let's talk money—because that's often the first question. A patient from {city_name} typically pays between ${gcc_min:,} and ${gcc_max:,} for {treatment} in the GCC. In Bangalore? The same procedure, same quality standards, runs between ${india_min:,} and ${india_max:,}.

That's a savings of {savings}. But here's what matters more: you're not compromising on quality to save money.

**Cost Breakdown for {city_name} Patients:**

| Expense | GCC | India | Your Savings |
|---------|-----|-------|--------------|
| Procedure Cost | ${gcc_min:,}-${gcc_max:,} | ${india_min:,}-${india_max:,} | {savings} |
| Hospital Stay (per night) | $800-1,200 | $150-300 | ~75% |
| Follow-up Consultations | $150-300 | $30-60 | ~80% |
| **Total Average Savings** | - | - | **${(gcc_min + gcc_max)//2 - (india_min + india_max)//2:,}+** |

*Note: Costs are estimates and vary based on complexity. Add ~$1,500-2,500 for flights and accommodation for companion.*

### Beyond the Price Tag

{random.choice([
    "But saving money means nothing if the quality isn't there. So let's address that head-on.",
    "Cost savings get attention, but here's what keeps patients coming back:",
    "Here's what actually matters when you're making this decision:",
])}

**1. Internationally Trained Surgeons**
Most cardiac surgeons in Bangalore have performed 2,000+ procedures. The surgeon who handles your case? Likely trained internationally and has success rates that match—or exceed—global benchmarks.

**2. Technology That's Current**
Da Vinci surgical robots, CyberKnife systems, 3T MRI scanners—Bangalore hospitals invest heavily in equipment. {random.choice(["Why? Competition.", "Simple reason: they have to compete globally.", "They're competing for international patients, which means staying current with technology."])}

**3. Arabic-Speaking Coordinators**
Every patient from {city_name} gets a dedicated coordinator who speaks Arabic. {random.choice([
    "They handle everything—airport pickup, hospital paperwork, doctor appointments, pharmacy runs, even booking your return flight.",
    "From the moment you land until you board your return flight, someone who speaks your language is available 24/7.",
    "No translator apps needed. No miscommunication about medical instructions. Just clear, direct communication in Arabic.",
])}

**4. Medical Visa Support**
{random.choice([
    "Getting an Indian medical visa from the UAE is straightforward—usually processed within 48-72 hours. We handle the paperwork.",
    "The visa process? We've done it hundreds of times. You provide the documents, we ensure everything's in order.",
    "Indian medical visas are actually easier than tourist visas. Processing takes 2-3 days, and we guide you through each step.",

### Before You Leave {city_name}

**Step 1: Free Consultation (Week 1)**
- Share your medical reports via WhatsApp (+91-80-1234-5678) or email
- Expert surgeon reviews within 24 hours (yes, including weekends)
- Receive detailed treatment plan and cost estimate
- No obligation, no payment required at this stage

    "We prioritize medical queries. While most companies take 3-5 days, our surgeons review cases within 24 hours.",
])}

**Step 2: Treatment Planning (Week 1-2)**
- Video consultation with your surgeon (if desired)
- Arabic coordinator assigned to your case
- Treatment timeline finalized

### In Bangalore

- Transfer to hotel (20-30 minutes from airport)
- Rest day (Day 1)
- Hospital consultation and pre-surgery tests (Day 2)
- Anesthesiologist consultation and final prep (Day 3)

{random.choice([
    "One thing patients always mention: how organized everything feels. No rushing, no chaos—just a well-planned schedule.",
    "We build in rest time. Flying, even if it's just 3-4 hours, is tiring. You need to be in good condition for surgery.",
    "The hospital is used to international patients. They know what questions GCC patients typically ask and proactively address them.",
])}

**Step 5: Surgery Day (Day 4)**
- Procedure performed by senior consultant
- Real-time updates sent to family back home
- Recovery in world-class ICU if needed

**Step 6: Recovery & Follow-up (Days 5-10)**
- Daily doctor rounds
- Physiotherapy (if required)
- Arabic coordinator visits daily
- Discharge planning

### Returning Home

**Step 7: Post-Treatment Care (Days 11-14)**

- Airport transfer for return flight

**After You're Back in {city_name}**

- 24/7 WhatsApp support
- Local doctor coordination if needed
- Medical records available anytime

{random.choice([
    "The care doesn't stop when you board your return flight. That's when follow-up becomes critical.",
    "Post-surgery support is where many medical tourism companies fail. We don't. Follow-up is included in your package.",
    "We stay in touch. Not daily check-ins—that's annoying—but scheduled video calls and responsive support when you need it.",
