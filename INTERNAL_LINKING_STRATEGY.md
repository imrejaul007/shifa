## Implementation Guidelines

### Anchor Text Best Practices

**Do's:**

- Use descriptive anchor text: "IVF treatment in Bangalore" not "click here"
- Vary anchor text for same destination
- Use natural language
- Include target keywords naturally

**Don'ts:**

- Over-optimize with exact-match keywords
- Use generic "read more" repeatedly
- Stuff keywords unnaturally
- Create broken links

### Technical Implementation

#### Example: Adding Links to Treatment Pillar Page

```tsx
// In IVF Pillar Page Component
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function IVFPillarClient({ locale }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Content section */}
      <p>
        Many patients also explore{' '}
        <Link href={`/${locale}/treatments/ayurveda-wellness`} className="text-accent underline">
          Ayurveda & Wellness treatments
        </Link>{' '}
        to complement their fertility journey...
      </p>

      {/* Related Treatments Section */}
      <section className="mt-16">
        <h2>Related Treatments</h2>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
          <Link href={`/${locale}/treatments/gynecology`}>
            <Card>
              <h3>Gynecology</h3>
              <p>Comprehensive women's health care...</p>
            </Card>
          </Link>
          {/* More treatment cards */}
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Success Stories Section */}
      <section className="mt-16">
        <h2>Success Stories</h2>
        <Link href={`/${locale}/blog/ahmed-dubai-ivf-success-story-bangalore`}>
