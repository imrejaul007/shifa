## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Routing Conflict Issue

**Original Problem:**

```
⨯ [Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('country' !== 'slug').]
```

Recurring every 10 seconds in production logs.

**Root Cause:**

- Conflicting dynamic routes at the same nesting level
- `/blog/[slug]` conflicted with `/blog/[country]`
- Next.js couldn't determine which route to use

**Solution Implemented:**

```
Before: /[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
After:  /[locale]/blog/posts/[slug]/page.tsx
```

Added "posts" static segment to differentiate routes.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Add 301 Redirects for SEO (Optional)

If you had existing blog posts at the old URL structure, add redirects:

```javascript
// In next.config.mjs
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:locale/blog/:slug',
      destination: '/:locale/blog/posts/:slug',
      permanent: true, // 301 redirect
    },
  ];
}
```

### 2. Monitor Production Logs (Recommended)

Continue monitoring for 24 hours to ensure stability:

- Check Render logs occasionally
- Verify no new errors appear
- Monitor application performance

### 3. Update Analytics (Optional)

If using Google Analytics or similar:

- Update tracked pages for new blog route structure
- Add goals for 27-city landing pages
- Monitor traffic to new city pages
