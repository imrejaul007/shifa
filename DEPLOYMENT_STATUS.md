# 🚀 Deployment Status - Routing Fix

**Date:** January 11, 2025
**Time:** 10:25 UTC
**Status:** 🔄 DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

---

## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Production Error (Recurring every 10s):**

```
⨯ [Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('country' !== 'slug').]
```

**Root Cause:**

- Render deployment was using **cached/old version** of code
- Previous deployment had conflicting routes: `/blog/[slug]` and `/blog/[country]`
- Fix was committed (cb9f2eb) but production didn't update

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Code Changes (Already Committed: cb9f2eb)

**Routing Restructure:**

- ❌ Old: `/blog/[slug]/` (conflicted with `/blog/[country]`)
- ✅ New: `/blog/posts/[slug]/` (no conflict)

**Files Moved:**

- `src/app/[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/blog/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/blog/[slug]/BlogPostClient.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/blog/posts/[slug]/BlogPostClient.tsx`

## 🎯 Expected Results

### What Should Happen

**1. Render Build Process:**

```bash
npm ci --include=dev
npm rebuild sharp
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run build          ← Fresh build with new routes
```

**2. Production Routes (After Deployment):**

```
✓ /[locale]/blog                                    ← Blog listing
✓ /[locale]/blog/posts/[slug]                       ← Database blog posts (NEW)
✓ /[locale]/blog/[country]/[city]/[treatment]/[slug] ← Medical tourism
```

**3. Production Logs (Expected):**

```
✓ Ready in 6-7s
✓ No routing errors
✓ Normal operation
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Build Cache Clearing

Render should automatically:

- Pull latest commit from `main` branch
- Clear old `.next` build cache
- Run fresh `npm run build`
- Deploy new build

### URL Pattern Changes

**Database Blog Posts URL Changed:**

- Old: `/blog/my-post`
- **New: `/blog/posts/my-post`**

**Recommended:** Add 301 redirect after deployment succeeds:

```javascript
// In next.config.mjs
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:locale/blog/:slug',
      destination: '/:locale/blog/posts/:slug',
      permanent: true,
    },
  ];
}
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Instructions

### Check Deployment Status

**1. Render Dashboard:**

- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Check deployment logs
- Verify build completes
- Check for errors

**2. Production Logs:**

```bash
# Watch for routing errors (should be NONE)
# Look for: "✓ Ready in Xs"
# Should NOT see: "⨯ [Error: You cannot use different slug names"
```

**3. Test Routes:**

```bash
# Homepage - should show 27 cities
curl https://your-domain.com/en

# Patient page - should show all cities
curl https://your-domain.com/en/for-uae-patients

# Blog post (if any exist)
curl https://your-domain.com/en/blog/posts/some-post
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Deployment will be considered **SUCCESSFUL** when:

1. ✅ Render build completes without errors
2. ✅ Production starts without routing errors
3. ✅ Logs show: `✓ Ready in Xs` (no error messages)
4. ✅ Homepage displays all 27 GCC cities
5. ✅ Patient pages show complete city sections
6. ✅ Blog routes accessible at new paths
7. ✅ No continuous error logging (every 10s)

---

## 🚨 If Deployment Still Fails

### Troubleshooting Steps

**1. Check Render Build Logs:**

- Verify it's building from commit `cb9f2eb` or later
- Check for build errors
- Verify `npm run build` completes

**2. Force Clear Render Cache:**

- Go to Render Dashboard
- Click "Clear Build Cache"
- Trigger manual redeploy

**3. Verify Git Commit:**

```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: "18fa54f Force Render redeploy"
```

**4. Check Route Structure:**

```bash
git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep "blog.*slug"
# Should show:
# src/app/[locale]/blog/posts/[slug]/page.tsx
# src/app/[locale]/blog/[country]/[city]/[treatment]/[slug]/page.tsx
```

**5. Nuclear Option - Clear Everything:**

```bash
# On Render Dashboard:
1. Click "Manual Deploy"
2. Select "Clear Build Cache"
3. Deploy
```
